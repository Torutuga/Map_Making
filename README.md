# Map_Making
Terrain Generator on Python, visualized in Pygame.

Based on Hans Theobald Beyer's Hydraulic Erosion algorithm.

Right now, the code runs from end to finish, but generates spikes in the terrain.
Debbuging needed.

Drop3.py holds all the functions needed for the algorithm.
Tester.py runs the whole algorithm.

Pygame, Opensimplex and Numpy libraries needed to run the code.
